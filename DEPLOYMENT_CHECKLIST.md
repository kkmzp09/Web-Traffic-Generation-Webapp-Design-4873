# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Files Created/Updated

- [x] `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- [x] `public/_redirects` - SPA routing support
- [x] `vite.config.js` - Updated base path to `/`
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- [x] `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Test Build Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
**Expected:** Creates `dist/` folder without errors

### 2. Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
**Expected:** App runs at http://localhost:4173

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Create `.env` file (if not exists) with:
```
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.organitrafficboost.com
```

---

## 🌐 Netlify Setup

### Method 1: Netlify CLI (Fastest)
```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Method 2: Git Integration (Recommended for Production)
1. Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Connect repository in Netlify Dashboard
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - **Node version:** 18

## ⚙️ Netlify Configuration

### Environment Variables to Add
Go to: Site settings → Environment variables

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `VITE_API_BASE` | `https://api.organitrafficboost.com` |

### Build Settings
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`
- **Node version:** 18 (set in netlify.toml)

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. Backend Server (`server.js`)
**Will NOT work on Netlify** - Netlify only hosts static files.

**Current Setup:** Frontend calls API directly at `https://api.organitrafficboost.com`

**Requirements:**
- API must have CORS enabled
- Your Netlify domain must be in API's allowed origins

**Alternative Solutions:**
- Use Netlify Functions for API proxy
- Deploy `server.js` separately (Render, Railway, Heroku)

### 2. Routing (HashRouter vs BrowserRouter)
**Current:** Using `HashRouter` (URLs have `#`)
- ✅ Works immediately on Netlify
- ❌ URLs look like: `yoursite.com/#/dashboard`

**Optional Upgrade:** Switch to `BrowserRouter`
- ✅ Clean URLs: `yoursite.com/dashboard`
- ✅ `_redirects` file already configured
- ⚠️ Requires changing `HashRouter` to `BrowserRouter` in `src/App.jsx`

### 3. API CORS Configuration
Ensure your API at `https://api.organitrafficboost.com` allows:
- Your Netlify domain (e.g., `https://your-app.netlify.app`)
- Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
- Headers: Content-Type, x-api-key, Authorization

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Login/Register functionality works
- [ ] API calls succeed (check browser console)
- [ ] Dashboard displays data
- [ ] Forms submit successfully

### Technical Tests
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] Images/assets load
- [ ] Favicon displays
- [ ] Meta tags are correct (view source)

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 2s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
**Check:**
- Run `npm run build` locally first
- Review Netlify build logs
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`

**Common Fixes:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### CORS Errors
**Symptoms:** API calls fail with CORS error in console

**Fix:** Add your Netlify domain to API's CORS allowed origins

### Page Not Found on Refresh
**Symptoms:** Refreshing any page shows 404

**Fix:** Already handled by `_redirects` file and `netlify.toml`

### Environment Variables Not Working
**Symptoms:** API calls go to wrong endpoint

**Fix:**
- Ensure variables start with `VITE_` prefix
- Redeploy after adding variables in Netlify Dashboard
- Clear browser cache

## 📊 Optimization Tips

### Performance
- Enable Netlify's asset optimization
- Enable image optimization (if using images)
- Use lazy loading for routes
- Minimize bundle size

### SEO
- Update meta tags in `index.html` with your domain
- Add sitemap.xml
- Add robots.txt
- Submit to Google Search Console

### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
- Enable Netlify Analytics
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Set up uptime monitoring
