# VALIDATION TEST - INSTRUCTIONS

## Debug logging is now ACTIVE on VPS

Please do the following:

1. Go to: https://organitrafficboost.com/seo-audit

2. Click "Run New Audit"

3. Enter URL: https://example.com

4. Wait 60-90 seconds for scan to complete

5. After scan completes, I will check PM2 logs for:
   🚀 FINAL TRANSFORMED ANALYSIS BEING SENT TO FRONTEND:
   {
     "score": <number>,
     "issues": [<array with items>],
     "summary": {...}
   }
   🚀 END FINAL ANALYSIS

This will prove:
- Real DataForSEO data is being fetched
- Transformation layer is working
- Issues array is populated
- Score is real (not mocked)

Please run the scan now and let me know when it's done.
Then I'll extract the logs and show you the proof.
