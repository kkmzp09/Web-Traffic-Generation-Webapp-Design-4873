## 🔍 How to Verify

### 1. Check Build Logs
After redeployment, check the build logs for:
```
✓ built in XXXms
```

### 2. Test Login
1. Go to your deployed site
2. Try to login with test credentials
3. Should redirect to `/dashboard` successfully

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open DevTools → Console, should NOT see:
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still getting 404
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue 2: "Failed to fetch" error
**Solution:** Check that your VPS auth API is running:
```bash
ssh root@your-vps-ip
pm2 list
# Should show auth-api running
```

### Issue 3: CORS errors
**Solution:** Your auth API needs CORS headers:
```javascript
// In your auth API server.js
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    'https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app',
    'https://www.organitrafficboost.com'
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```
